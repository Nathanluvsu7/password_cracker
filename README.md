This tool is designed to test password strength by attempting authentication against different targets using automated techniques. It supports multiple attack vectors, including:

HTTP POST requests – Useful for testing web-based login forms and APIs

Local authentication tests – For validating password policies on local systems

FTP authentication – For assessing legacy or misconfigured FTP services

The tool can be configured with custom wordlists, request parameters, and target settings, making it suitable for controlled security testing and educational purposes.
